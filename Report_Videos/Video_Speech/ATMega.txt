We have connected 3 sensors with atmega32 such as dht11, ds18b20 and pulse sensor. dht11 gives us surrounding temp and humidity. With these readings the user immidiately knows the condition of the weather. He/She can decide whether to take rest/ burn more calories.
ds18b20 gives the body temp and Pulse sensor gives the pulse rate which indicates to the internal body condition.
These readings are then transmitted to Arduino uno through uart serial communication. Arduino receives those readings through rx pin.
